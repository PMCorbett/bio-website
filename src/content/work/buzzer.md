## Remember Lockdown Zoom Quizzes?

Back during lockdown, like many families, my family and I played quizzes and other games via zoom.

My family (like many families, I guess) can get quite competitive when it comes to quizzes. So when a quick fire question round came up, it was often the loudest to shout that got to give the answer. This led to arguments, heckling and the all round breakdown of civilisation.

The solution was to have a simple website with a big button that could record buzzes, so people in disparate locations could buzz, and there would be no arguments as to who buzzed when, as it would be recorded to the millisecond.

The technology worked perfectly.

The arguments continued.
